/**
 * Builder for the hashCode integrity test. The resulting test will apply the following criteria
 * to the class under test:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> the hashCode method must be implemented
 * <li> the result of hashCode method of two instances must be equal, if the instances are equal according to their equals implementation
 * <li> if included properties have been provided
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li> the included properties must be included in the implementation
 * 		<li> all not included properties must not be included in the implementation
 * 	</ul>
 * <li> if excluded properties have been provided
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li> the excluded properties must be excluded from the implementation
 * 		<li> all not excluded properties must be included in the implementation
 * 	</ul>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If neither includes nor excludes have been specified, all public settable properties
 * are expected to be included in the implementation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Caution:</b> You can either provide included or excluded properties, not both.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>When to use excludes:</b> Use excludes to make sure that no additional properties
 * can be added to the class under test without either altering the test or extending
 * the hashCode implementation. This strategy aims for an accurate and complete hashCode
 * implementation in order to cover as much of the class' state variations as possible.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>When to use includes:</b> Use includes to make sure that no additional properties
 * can be added to the hashCode implementation without altering the test. This strategy
 * aims for high-performance of the hashCode implementation, rather than for correctness.
 * This strategy should only be used, when performance is prioritized to correctness.
