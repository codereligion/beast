/**
 * Tests the integrity of the equals implementation by using an include strategy. This means the user can provide
 * included properties which must be included in the equals implementation. This approach is specifically
 * useful when the class under test has properties of which only one or a few properties must be considered in 
 * the equals implementation e.g. for performance reasons. Good include candidates may be primary keys, foreign keys
 * and alike properties.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This strategy will throw an {@link AssertionError} if it finds a property which has not been included by the user
 * and is included in the equals implementation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Furthermore it will throw an {@link AssertionError} if it finds a property which has been included by the user
 * but is excluded in the equals implementation, thus has been included unnecessarily .
