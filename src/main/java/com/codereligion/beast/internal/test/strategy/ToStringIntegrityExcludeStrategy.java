 * <p/>
 * This strategy will throw an {@link AssertionError} if it finds a property which has not been excluded by the user and is not included in the toString
 * implementation.

 * Furthermore it will throw an {@link AssertionError} if it finds a property which has been excluded by the user but is included in the toString
 * implementation, thus has been excluded unnecessarily .
