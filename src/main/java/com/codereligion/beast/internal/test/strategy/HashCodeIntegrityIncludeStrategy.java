/**
 * Tests the integrity of the hashCode implementation by using an include strategy. This means the user can provide
 * included properties which must be included in the hashCode implementation. This approach is specifically
 * useful when the class under test has properties of which only one or a few properties must be considered in 
 * the hashCode implementation e.g. for performance reasons. Good include candidates may be primary keys, foreign keys
 * and alike properties.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This strategy will throw an {@link AssertionError}, if the given {@code propertyName} was not in the includes,
 * but for which the {@code defaultObject} and {@code dirtyObject} have different hashCode results.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Furthermore it will throw an {@link AssertionError}, if the given {@code propertyName} was in the includes,
 * but for which the {@code defaultObject} and {@code dirtyObject} have the same hashCode result. Thus
 * the include was unnecessary.
