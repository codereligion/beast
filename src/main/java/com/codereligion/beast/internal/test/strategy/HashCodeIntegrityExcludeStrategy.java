 * <p>
 * This strategy will throw an {@link AssertionError} if it finds a property which has not been excluded by the user
 * and is not included in the hashCode implementation.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Furthermore it will throw an {@link AssertionError} if it finds a property which has been excluded by the user
 * but is included in the hashCode implementation, thus has been excluded unnecessarily .
